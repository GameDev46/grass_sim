# grass_sim

A basic field scene created in THREE.js

# What is this?

This is a simple field scene setup in THREE.js that can be run on the web! It focuses heavily on the rendering of grass along with a modified grass sway shader to try to replicate the behaviours of real life grass and also contains a grass LOD (Level of detail) system that changes the mesh depending on how far from the camera it currently is to boost performance

# Wesbite

You can run the program in realtime [here, on its website](https://gamedev46.github.io/grass_sim) as it is programmed using HTML, CSS, JS and GLSL which is implemented using the WebGL shader library
